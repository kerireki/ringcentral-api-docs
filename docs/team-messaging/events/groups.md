# Chat events for Team Messaging

Chat events, also known as "group" events, are triggered when some aspect of a chat (a conversation or team) has changed. There are four types of chat events:

* Chat renamed
* Person joined or was added to chat
* Person left of was removed from chat
* Group or chat name/description changed 

Each event type has a unique payload and structure depending upon the event type. The structure of a chat event is [documented within the API Reference](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Team-Messaging-Groups-Event), but a few examples are shown below. 

When [subscribing](outgoing-webhooks.md#subscribing-to-an-outgoing-event) to chat events you will need to specify the following event filter:

* `/team-messaging/v1/groups`

Once a subscription has been setup, your application will begin receiving events at the designated URL.
