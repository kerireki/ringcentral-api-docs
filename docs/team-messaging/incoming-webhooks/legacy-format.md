# RingCentral's legacy attachment formats

Prior to [adaptive cards](../adaptive-cards/index.md) RingCentral supported its own proprietary format for creating richly formatted cards. Overt time we developed two different schemas, creatively named "version 1" and "version 2." These formats are documented below.

!!! tip "Adaptive Cards"
    While RingCentral continues to support our proprietary format, we encourage developers to adopt the more robust and modern [Adaptive Cards framework](../adaptive-cards/index.md) for composing cards and messages.
	
!!! note "What to be aware of when using message attachments"
    * All fields except `text` have a character limit of 300 bytes.
    * The cummulative size limit for all attachments is 1.5M bytes. 
    * "Mini-markdown," a RingCentral flavor of Markdown, provides some text formatting options (bold, italics, links, etc.)

=== "Version 2"

    Older RingCentral apps may still be using our legacy card schema. The version 2 schema is only supported by incoming webhook URLs that include the 'v2' path element as show below:

    * `https://hooks.glip.com/webhooks/v2/abcdefg...`
    * `https://hooks.ringcentral.com/webhooks/v2/abcdefg...`
		 
    ### Example message and attachment
	
	```http
    POST /webhook/v2/eyJhbGciOiJI.xxxxxx.zI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
    Host: hooks.ringcentral.com
    Content-Type: application/json
	
    {!> code-samples/team-messaging/adaptive-cards/legacy-v2.json !}
	```

## Mini-Markdown: a RingCentral flavor of Markdown

Our legacy card formats support a simplified version of Markdown to assist in the formatting of text within a message. The following syntaxes are supported for post attachments in addition to post bodies.

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr><th scope="col">Mini-markdown</th><th scope="col">Resulting Text</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>*italics*</td><td><i>italics</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>**bold**</td><td><b>bold</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>_underline_</td><td><u>underline</u></td></tr>
<tr><td>[a link](http://example.com)</td><td><a href="http://example.com">a link</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt; quote</td><td><blockquote>quote</blockquote></td></tr>
<tr><td>* bullet</td><td><ul><li>bullet</li></ul></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
