# Detecting State Changes to an Active Call

There are two primary ways in which a developer can detect a change in the status of an active call:

1. By monitoring the presence status of an extension on the network
2. By subscribing to a specific call (a.k.a. telephony session) on the network

What a developer subscribes to depends largely upon the use case. For example, subscribing to presence events provides a good way of establishing a call control policy that relates to a fixed extension on the network. However, perhaps call handling logic requires custom policies to be enforced on the fly depending upon the call itself. In which case subscribing to a specific call and waiting for the call to enter a specific state is probably best. 

## Creating a Subscription

Detailed instructions on [creating webhooks and subscriptions](../notifications/index.md) can be found elsewhere in the Developer Guide. As a convenience, here is how one would subscribe to receive both presence and telephony session events via a push notification.

```
POST /restapi/v1.0/subscription

{
  "eventFilters": [
    "/restapi/v1.0/account/~/telephony/sessions",
    "/restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/~/presence?detailedTelephonyState=true&sipData=true"
  ],
  "deliveryMode": {
    "transportType": "PubNub"
  }
}
```

## Subscribing to presence notifications

Presence events are triggered whenever a user's availability changes. This may or may not relate to the user being on a call or not. Therefore, it is important for developers to be able to disambiguate between these different availability state changes, and respond accordinglyâ€”ignoring some (e.g. a user changes their do not disturb status), and responding to others (e.g. a user answers their phone).

            "direction": "Inbound",
            "fromName": "TheCat Jerry",
            "from": "103",
            "toName": "Tom Sawyer",
            "to": "102",

            },
            "partyId":"cs171843418296416309-2",

        "pickUpCallsOnHold": false,
        "totalActiveCalls": 1
      }
    }
  }
```

!!! note "Limitations"
    Legacy BLF solutions might not support some complex PBX scenarios. In Release 10.2 we've added `activeCalls.telephonySessionId` and `activeCalls.partyId` to allow Customers to use Telephony API. You can also use a GET call on the Presence endpoint to get details on active calls for a current user.

## Subscribing to telephony sessions

Developers can receive notifications about telephony session state changes for a single user/extension, or for all users across an entire account. The following subscription event filters are used accordingly:

* **Account-level Event Filter**: `/restapi/v1.0/account/~/telephony/sessions`
* **Extension-level Event Filter**: `/restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/~/telephony/sessions`

```

!!! note "Current limitations of telephony notifications"
    In our initial implementation, notifications won't be delivered in the following scenarios:
    
    * if a party doesn't belong to subscriber account/extension (another RC account, PSTN, intermediate parties, etc).
    * if a party belongs to another session (transferred call, conference, etc).
    * if a party does not belong to any accountId or mailboxId (some parties are created to represent intermediate "leg", e.g. to connect telephony session with RC Conference)
