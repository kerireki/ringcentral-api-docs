  <p class="lead">The RingCentral Meetings API gives developers the ability to create, schedule, update and delete meetings. In addition, the API gives one access to the list of dial-in phone numbers, URLs, and other connection information so that organizers can compose proper invitations to meeting attendees.</p>
  <p>We invite all developers to try out our Meeting API by writing a simple app to schedule a meeting in almost no time at all. Get started using a Quick Start in any of the following languages:</p>

## How do I schedule a meeting?

The primary purpose of the Meetings API is to enable developers to create and schedule meetings with others. The sequence of creating a meeting and inviting others would be as follows:

1. Create meeting using the [Create Meeting API](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Meeting-Management/createMeeting)
2. [Get the Meeting Service Info](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Meeting-Configuration/readMeetingServiceInfo) in order to compose an invitation with all the necessary connection information.
3. Send your invitation to desired attendees.

## How do I invite people to attend a meeting?

RingCentral meetings can be attended by anyone who has a link, so there is no API needed in order to add participants. Just create the meeting, obtain the meeting URL, and send it to whomever needs to attend.
