If you have previously submitted an App Gallery profile, you can create a revision to submit for review. When making a revision to existing profile, you do not need to worry about overwriting your existing profile, as we review all changes prior to making them public.

## Click "Edit"

To create a revision, find the app whose profile you would like to edit. Click the "App Gallery" menu option. Then click "Edit."

When you are done, click the button "Submit for approval." Within 3-5 business days our team will review your revision, and notify you via email if there are any further actions you need to take prior to approving your edits.
