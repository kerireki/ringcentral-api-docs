# Application permissions and scopes

In order to work with particular RingCentral API resources the application should have the corresponding scopes associated with it, also referred to as application "permissions." Required scopes are generally declared at the stage of application registration and confirmed by the user during the authorization stage of connecting to that application.

Adding and removing scopes is accomplished in the Developer Console by editing the application's settings.

## Application vs user permissions

Setting an application's scope does not by itself confer upon a user of that application the ability to perform the associated action. Setting the scope merely declares that an application needs the ability to perform a specific action in order to function properly. Therefore, in order for a user of an application to perform a given operation, the app must declare the corresponding scope, and the user must have been assigned a role that possesses the corresponding user permission as well. 

## Requesting access to restricted app scopes

As you are adding scopes to your application, you may notice some scopes have the text "(requires permission)" next to them. This indicates an application scope that is restricted in some way, often for an abundance of caution and concerns for security. When you add a restricted app scope to your app, you will be prompted to provide a justification for why your app requires the ability to perform the actions associated with that app scope. Then, when you save the settings of that app, a request will be filed with the support to review your petition, and approve (or reject) your request accordingly. 

To maximize the likelihood of your request being approved, please provide a detailed, well-written response to the justification prompt.
