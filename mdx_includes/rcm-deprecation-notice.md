??? warning "The RingCentral Meetings API has been deprecated"
     The RingCentral Meetings API is being phased out in favor of our newer [RingCentral Video API](../video/index.md). Existing applications that have access to the Meetings API will continue to be supported, but new applications that require access to the RingCentral Meetings API will need to request the "Meetings" app scope be added to their application by a RingCentral support representative.
